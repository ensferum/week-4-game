// Create a variable and assign it to randomly generated target number 



// Create a counter for the # of Wins

// Create a counter for the # of Losses




// Create a variable that stores a randomly generated number between 1-12 for crystal 1
	//on click event that that links to the total score

// Create a variable that stores a randomly generated number between 1-12 for crystal 2
	//on click event that that links to the total score

// Create a variable that stores a randomly generated number between 1-12 for crystal 3
	//on click event that that links to the total score

// Create a variable that stores a randomly generated number between 1-12 for crystal 4
	//on click event that that links to the total score


// Create a variable that stores click events from each crystal being targeted

//Set win if the total score = targeted number

//Set loss if the total score !== targeted number (goes over it)

//Automatically restart the randomly generated number and clear the total score
